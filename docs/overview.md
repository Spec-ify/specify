# Overview the Specify client

## Summary
The Specify client is written in C#, and targets .net version 4.7.2. It collects system info and uploads it to [Specified](https://github.com/Spec-ify/specified) (If it fails or is manually set to do otherwise, it will generate `specified_specs.json` in the same directory as the executable. This can be then uploaded to a viewer like https://spec-ify.com or browsed manually.
